## MVP of the Regression Project

The goal of this project is to find the best ARIMA model that can fit the stock prices of Starbucks Corp and then predict the close price of Starbucks in one year from 6/12/2021 to 6/12/2022, using the ARIMA time series model.

For this project, I divided the collected data into train, validation, and test. As you may see, the data is not divided by the years, and there is a down in 2020, so I included this in the training data set. so the training set goes from 2016 till the first month in 2021.


As you may see, based on some programming and mathematics, I came up with these plots, which represent the prediction of the next year from the date 6-12-2021 until 6-12-2021. However, we cannot be 100% sure of this prediction, taking into consideration that I only used one feature, and the date.
